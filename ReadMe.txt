Hey Amardeep, 
I've really enjoyed this project it was tough in parts but rewarding to see it finished and working. 
Ive only been coding for 2 years now and still have alot to learn but I love coding and developing projects, so I know ive chosen a great career path.
In the aim of becoming a better programmer I would really appreciate any genuine feedback on my project, things I could do better or make my code smaller and more efficient
Thanks heaps.

Dan.
